# BusyBeaver
simple, functional. no GUI. builds in eclipse NOTE: not standalone

This is a small project to create a fun-to-use program to play the 'Busy Beaver' game.
It simulates large amounts of tape going either way instead of setting an amount at the beginning,
and has configurable rest times between steps making it practical for complex sets of states (as practical as the set anyway!)
Currently needs a GUI and could stand to be standalone...
