# BusyBeaver
Simple, functional. No GUI. Built in Eclipse

This is a small project to create a fun-to-use program to play the 'Busy Beaver' game.
It simulates large amounts of tape going either way instead of setting an amount at the beginning,
and has configurable rest times between steps making it practical for complex sets of states (as practical as the set anyway!)

Contributors Could:
- Add GUI and modify "back-end" code to accomodate
- Condense or clarify code with the end-goal being an easily understandable and efficient program
